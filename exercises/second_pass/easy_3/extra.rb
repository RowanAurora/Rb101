# vowels = aieou
#
# find all of the vowel substrings
# find the longest of the vowel substrings

#EXAMPLE
vowel_substrings('codewarriors') == 2

# The vowel substrings in the word codewarriors are 
# o,e,a,io. The longest of these has a length of 2.
# Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic
# characters only (both vowels and consonants) 
# and no spaces, return the length of the longest 
# vowel substring. Vowels are any of aeiou.


a = 'a'

if a == 'a'  # <== the return value of this line
  'boop'     # <== this portion is returned by the whole if else
